# UUIDv1_Timestamps_Generator

This is a quick and dirty script used to generate version 1 UUIDs. You can provide an original UUID, a start date and end date to generate a list of UUIDs. This can be helpful when brute-forcing UUIDs in certain scenarios.

Note: Start and end dates must be 7 digits after the decimal point.
